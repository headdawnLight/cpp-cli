# cpp-cli-calculator

This is a simple calculator program running in a command line interface. It was developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with the C++ programming language.

## Introduction

The basic universal computation process consists of four operations. These are addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. These operations are called arithmetic operations in mathematics.

Arithmetic operations form the basic working principle of calculators. To perform a simple arithmetic operation, we need two operands and an operator. The operator processes the two operands and the computation is done.

This program, prepared with this logic, first asks the user for the first operand, then the operator, and then the second operand. When the process is completed, the program performs its last task and asks if you want to perform a new action.

This is the first program I developed while learning the basics of programming. You can access the source code of this program and run and test it in your own development environment.

Technology and tools I used while developing this program:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- C++
- Git
- GitHub

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/headdawnLight/cpp-cli-calculator.git
    
Run and test the source codes in your own development environment. 

## Usage

Step by step

1. Enter the first operand number.

2. Enter the operator to perform arithmetic operation.

3. Enter the second operand number.

4. Enter the "C" key to perform another operation.

5. Enter the "E" key to exit the program.
